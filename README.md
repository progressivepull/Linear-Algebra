# Linear-Algebra
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.

* **[Vectors:](./Vectors.ipynb)**
Represent quantities with both magnitude and direction, often visualized as arrows.

* **Matrices:**
Rectangular arrays of numbers used to represent linear transformations and systems of equations.

* **Linear Transformations:**
Functions that map vectors to other vectors while preserving linear combinations.

* **Vector Spaces:**
Sets of vectors where addition and scalar multiplication are defined, following certain rules.

* **Linear Equations:**
Equations where variables are multiplied by constants and added together, often represented in matrix form.

* **Determinants:**
A scalar value that can be calculated from a square matrix, providing information about the matrix's properties.

* **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:**
Special values and vectors associated with a matrix that preserve their direction when the matrix is applied.

* **Basis:**
A set of linearly independent vectors that can span a vector space.

## Applications:
* **Physics:** Solving systems of equations, describing motion, and analyzing physical systems.
* **Economics**: Modeling economic systems and predicting economic outcomes.
* **Computer Science:** Image processing, computer graphics, data analysis, and machine learning.
* **Engineering:** Structural analysis, control systems, and signal processing.
